# Conclusions:
Dicsounts increase sales on a per order basis but the level of discount is not significant.
Northwind makes much greater revenue selling alcoholic beverages than non-alcoholic beverages but on a per order basis there is not
The Seattle office makes 2.5x the revenue of the London office, but on a per sale basis they do not vary significantly
No significant difference in freight costs between the 3 shipping companies.

### Recommendations:
Offer more discounts on products but keep them low.
Expand the non-alcoholic beverage product line.
Explore why the team in London is not making as many sales, use the Seattle office as a model.
Continue to negotiate rates with the 3 companies to make shipping as cost-efficient as possible.

### Further Work:
Are discounts more effective on certain products or regions?
Market research into beverage sales and trends. What new non-alcoholic products are likely to be successful?
Study sales by region and office - assess whether sales teams should be assembled in other cities.
Effectiveness of shipping companies by region or product. Is there any statistical difference in shipping speeds?
